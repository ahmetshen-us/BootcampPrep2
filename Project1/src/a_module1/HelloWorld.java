// Java is case sensitive means what?

//Select all the features of Java:
//Object oriented
//Compiled
//Memory management

//What is a compiler?
//The part of Java that translates your source code into machine code
// Which part is this?

//Which of the following are valid names for Java classes according to convention?
//Hello World
//Hello_World
//helloWorld
//HelloWorld

//What is a Class?
//The class is the outermost layer of the program. It starts with the keywords "public class" and then whatever the name of your file is.

//public class YourClass {
//The name of your class has to exactly match the name of your file, including capitalization. The class is enclosed by a set of curly braces or "{ }" characters. All code you want to run should be placed between these two characters.

//Main Method
//
//The main method is the wrapper that tells your computer which lines of code to run. In Java it has a very specific series of keywords:
//
//public static void main(String[] args) {
//After the open curly brace, you should put each line of code you want the computer to run. Don't forget to add the closing curly brace after all your code. As you can see in the image it is convention to add a layer of indentation between the main method and the class, this shows that the main method is inside the class.
//3-mainMethod


//Statements
//
//The statements are the lines of code for the computer to run. 
//Each line is called a "statement" and should end with a semi-colon(;).
//You can have as many statements as you want, the computer will run each line from top to bottom one after the other. Again, as these are inside the main method all statements should be one level of indentation in.

//What is the name of the outermost wrapper that contains all your code
//Class

//What happens if you forget to add a semi-colon at the end of a line of code?
//The computer reports a "compiler error"

//Comments are notes written in the source code by the programmer to describe or clarify the code. They are ignored by the Java compiler so they are intended only as messages to the humans that will read the code files.

/*
multi line comments are placed 
between the slash and asterisk markers
*/

// single line comments are placed after double forward slashes


//Select all the places you should put comments
//On every line
//Above the class header
//After the last curly brace
//Above each method
//To describe particularly tricky lines of code
