//	As the last two sections showed, you need to be careful when combining values of different data types. Java lets you explicitly change data from type to another or "cast" the data to a different type. You do this by expressly calling out what you want your data type to be after evaluation:
//
//	(resultingDataType) expression;
	
	

	System.out.println(10);
	System.out.println((double)10);//cast int to double
	System.out.println(10*1.0);//combine int with double
	
//	What is the correct syntax to turn 1 into 1.0?
//	(double) 1;
	
//	What is the result of the following expression?
//	(int) (10.0/3.0)
// 3

}
